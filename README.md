# ls.v

Uhm, yeah I did this again. Just trying out V and I really like it so far.

## Compiling

```bash
v .
```

## Running

```bash
./ls [-a] [path]
```

I have only implemented the `-a` flag, and the path is optional, if not provided it will list the current directory.

## What do I think about V?

- It's fast
- It has a robust standard library
- Writing _fast_ code is somewhat easier
- It's easy to learn (It's a smooth blend between Go and Rust, it has also picked a lot of good stuff from other languages like Zig)
- The compiler is much smarter and helpful than Go's compiler
- It's still in beta, so it's not ready for production yet, but it's getting there
- It's not as mature as Go, so it's not as easy to find help online
- The LSP really sucks too

Overall, I think V is a great language, and I'm looking forward to see how it evolves, and I hope it gets more traction in the future because it's a really good language, I think it's better than Go in many ways, and it's also better than Rust in some ways, so I think it has a lot of potential.
